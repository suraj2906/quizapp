## Assumptions Made
### Number of Questions: The application assumes that there are only 10 questions to be answered, and the user will progress through them in sequence.
### Navigation: The user is not allowed to navigate to previous questions once they have answered them.
### No Authentication: No authentication system (such as login/signup) is implemented as only one user interacts with the app.
